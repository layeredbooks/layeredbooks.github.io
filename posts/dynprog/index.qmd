# Dynamic Programming

_This post is a work in progress_

I learned the term _dynamic programming_ during my master thesis work. 

I was a long time ago, and my work was in the field of image processing.

I called it image processing, but it was also referred to as computer vision. Neural networks were there, but not yet used for computer vision.

To be more precise, the goal was to process images, from inside an industrial furnace, with the goal of establishing the boundary between a light region 
and a dark region.

The light region was there because of fire (it was a bark furnace, used for generation of heat, and perhaps electricity), and the dark region was where
there was no fire.

We called the boundary for the _ash line_.

We can assume that the ash line, if it could be detected, would be a boundary, dividing the image in two halves - an upper and a lower half.

Having established the position of the ash line, across an image, the next goal was to control the burning in the furnace so that the 
ash line became located at a desired position. This was not done in my master thesis, where the goal was to locate the ash line.

As a first approach, I tried different ways of segmenting the image, using methods such as thresholding, or finding a boundary using 
image gradients.

This worked well for some images, and not so well for others.

About halfway in to the work, my thesis advisor proposed that I should try dynamic programming.

I had no clue what was meant with those words.

I got a reference to a book chapter, where the usage of dynamic programming for image processing was described.

## Application to image processing

## What do the control guys say?

## How can we relate to dynamic programming as used in computer science?

## Where to go from here
