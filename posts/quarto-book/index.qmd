# A Quarto book

Here is how I created a book using Quarto.

I started with installing Quarto, using the downloadable file found on
the Quarto [Get Started page](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/){target="_blank"}. 

Starting out with R Studio as the IDE, thinking that this was the only option, I switched to using 
[VSCode](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html){target="_blank"}.

Using the VSCode Quarto extension, I could now create a book, using Command-Shift-P (I am on a Mac) and the choosing
the function _Quarto: Create Project_.

This led to a book with two chapters, a reference section with a reference to Donald E Knuth's _Literate Programming_.

I could render the book, in html and pdf, using the command (in the VSCode Terminal)
```
quarto render
```

The pdf rendering relied on LaTeX, which I installed from this [MacTex page](https://tug.org/mactex/){target="_blank"}.

You can read about LaTex recommendations for Quarto in the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html){target="_blank"}.

The book can be viewed, in a browser, by issuing the command
```
quarto preview
```

The pdf version of the book can be found in the directory `_book` (which was created as a result of the _quarto render_ command)

## Setting author and title

Looking in the file `_quarto.yml`, I found placeholders for title and author, as

```
  title: "intocontrol_book"
  author: "Norah Jones"
```

I changed those, and also the date, which was on the line below where the author was stated.

## Adding some equations

I wrote some equations, in the `intro.qmd` file, using LaTex as I learned it when I was working in University.

Using the notation

```
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot x &= Ax + Bu \\
y &= Cx + Du
\end{aligned}
$$
```
I got a nicely displayed equation, however without any equation number.

Changing the notation, with inspiration from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75230272/losing-equations-numbering-when-i-render-quarto-document-to-word){target="_blank"} and 
the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#equations){target="_blank"}, to

```
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot x &= Ax + Bu \\
y &= Cx + Du
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-state-space}
```

I saw that an equation number appeared.
